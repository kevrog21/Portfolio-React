                                        <p>I created this poster for my college's Jazz Orchestra to promote their Spring 2020 concert. My objective was to create a monochromatic design that portrayed the theme of the concert which was "A Night at the Movies".</p>
                                        <p>I was inspired to include the superhero theme in my design because the band was performing songs from movies like <i>The Incredibles</i>, <i>James Bond</i>, <i>Spiderman</i>, and other blockbuster films. Since the poster was promoting such a fun event, it was a great opportunity to create a playful design. The result is the design you see here of two jazz orchestra instruments posing like superheroes atop a building â€“ ready to save the day with their awesome tunes.</p>

                                    <p>This project required careful consideration of typography because there was a lot of text to include so I had to be careful not to overwhelm the viewer.</p>

                                    <p>I used the typeface Gill Sans Ultra Bold for the display type because it's fun &amp; funky like the music of the performance.
